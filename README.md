# โค้ด (@dtinth’s VS Code Fork)

I had to fork VS Code to implement some features that would not be possible using [VS Code’s Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/overview).

## Added features

- [**Chorded Snippets**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/46487) — This allows me to type words by smashing multiple keys at once. For example, if I define this snippet:

	```js
	"const": {
		"prefix": "nst",
		"chorded": true,
		"body": [
			"const "
		]
	},
	```

	Note the `"chorded": true` directive. Now, if I smashed the <kbd>n</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>t</kbd> keys simultaneously (order doesn’t matter, but both 3 keys must be pressed at the same time) it will activate the snippet.

- [**Rainbow Strings**](https://medium.com/hacking-atom/rainbow-strings-94a2b99cf8b7) — I prefer strings to be colorful, so in this fork if you set a text color to a magic color, `#fefeff`, then it turns into a rainbow.

	```js
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
      "strings": "#fefeff"
    },
	```

## Demo

- Chords: `fun`&rarr;`function$1 () {}`, `con`&rarr;`console.log($1)`, `ret`&rarr;`return`, `fal`&rarr;`false`
- Rainbow strings (`'Hello'`)

## Building

1. Clone this repository.

2. Yarn.

	```
	yarn
	```

3. Build (for macOS).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of
a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code
provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

VS Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, you can install the [Insiders version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders). This builds from the master branch and is updated at least daily.
